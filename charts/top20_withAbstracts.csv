Pan, SJ  (2010)	Pan, SJ	A Survey on Transfer Learning	2010	4	"Transfer learning; survey; machine learning; data mining"	A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.
Shelhamer, E  (2017)	Shelhamer, E	Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation	2017	1	"Semantic Segmentation; Convolutional Networks; Deep Learning; Transfer Learning"	"Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build ""fully convolutional"" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image."
Girshick, R  (2016)	Girshick, R	Region-Based Convolutional Networks for Accurate Object Detection and Segmentation	2016	1	"Object recognition; detection; semantic segmentation; convolutional networks; deep learning; transfer learning"	Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC Challenge datasets, plateaued in the final years of the competition. The best-performing methods were complex ensemble systems that typically combined multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 50 percent relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012-achieving a mAP of 62.4 percent. Our approach combines two ideas: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data are scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, boosts performance significantly. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call the resulting model an R-CNN or Region-based Convolutional Network. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/similar to rbg/rcnn.
Pan, SJ  (2011)	Pan, SJ	Domain Adaptation via Transfer Component Analysis	2011	2	"Dimensionality reduction; domain adaptation; Hilbert space embedding of distributions; transfer learning"	Domain adaptation allows knowledge from a source domain to be transferred to a different but related target domain. Intuitively, discovering a good feature representation across domains is crucial. In this paper, we first propose to find such a representation through a new learning method, transfer component analysis (TCA), for domain adaptation. TCA tries to learn some transfer components across domains in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space using maximum mean miscrepancy. In the subspace spanned by these transfer components, data properties are preserved and data distributions in different domains are close to each other. As a result, with the new representations in this subspace, we can apply standard machine learning methods to train classifiers or regression models in the source domain for use in the target domain. Furthermore, in order to uncover the knowledge hidden in the relations between the data labels from the source and target domains, we extend TCA in a semisupervised learning setting, which encodes label information into transfer components learning. We call this extension semisupervised TCA. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a novel dimensionality reduction framework for reducing the distance between domains in a latent space for domain adaptation. We propose both unsupervised and semisupervised feature extraction approaches, which can dramatically reduce the distance between domain distributions by projecting data onto the learned transfer components. Finally, our approach can handle large datasets and naturally lead to out-of-sample generalization. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are verified by experiments on five toy datasets and two real-world applications: cross-domain indoor WiFi localization and cross-domain text classification.
Duan, LX  (2012)	Duan, LX	Domain Transfer Multiple Kernel Learning	2012	2	"Cross-domain learning; domain adaptation; transfer learning; support vector machine; multiple kernel learning"	Cross-domain learning methods have shown promising results by leveraging labeled patterns from the auxiliary domain to learn a robust classifier for the target domain which has only a limited number of labeled samples. To cope with the considerable change between feature distributions of different domains, we propose a new cross-domain kernel learning framework into which many existing kernel methods can be readily incorporated. Our framework, referred to as Domain Transfer Multiple Kernel Learning (DTMKL), simultaneously learns a kernel function and a robust classifier by minimizing both the structural risk functional and the distribution mismatch between the labeled and unlabeled samples from the auxiliary and target domains. Under the DTMKL framework, we also propose two novel methods by using SVM and prelearned classifiers, respectively. Comprehensive experiments on three domain adaptation data sets (i.e., TRECVID, 20 Newsgroups, and email spam data sets) demonstrate that DTMKL-based methods outperform existing cross-domain learning and multiple kernel learning methods.
Gao, J  (2014)	Gao, J	Transfer Learning Based Visual Tracking with Gaussian Processes Regression	2014	2		Modeling the target appearance is critical in many modern visual tracking algorithms. Many tracking-by-detection algorithms formulate the probability of target appearance as exponentially related to the confidence of a classifier output. By contrast, in this paper we directly analyze this probability using Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR), and introduce a latent variable to assist the tracking decision. Our observation model for regression is learnt in a semi-supervised fashion by using both labeled samples from previous frames and the unlabeled samples that are tracking candidates extracted from the current frame. We further divide the labeled samples into two categories: auxiliary samples collected from the very early frames and target samples from most recent frames. The auxiliary samples are dynamically re-weighted by the regression, and the final tracking result is determined by fusing decisions from two individual trackers, one derived from the auxiliary samples and the other from the target samples. All these ingredients together enable our tracker, denoted as TGPR, to alleviate the drifting issue from various aspects. The effectiveness of TGPR is clearly demonstrated by its excellent performances on three recently proposed public benchmarks, involving 161 sequences in total, in comparison with state-of-the-arts.
Donahue, J  (2017)	Donahue, J	Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Networks for Visual Recognition and Description	2017	1	"Computer vision; convolutional nets; deep learning; transfer learning"	"Models based on deep convolutional networks have dominated recent image interpretation tasks; we investigate whether models which are also recurrent are effective for tasks involving sequences, visual and otherwise. We describe a class of recurrent convolutional architectures which is end-to-end trainable and suitable for large-scale visual understanding tasks, and demonstrate the value of these models for activity recognition, image captioning, and video description. In contrast to previous models which assume a fixed visual representation or perform simple temporal averaging for sequential processing, recurrent convolutional models are ""doubly deep"" in that they learn compositional representations in space and time. Learning long-term dependencies is possible when nonlinearities are incorporated into the network state updates. Differentiable recurrent models are appealing in that they can directly map variable-length inputs (e.g., videos) to variable-length outputs (e.g., natural language text) and can model complex temporal dynamics; yet they can be optimized with backpropagation. Our recurrent sequence models are directly connected to modern visual convolutional network models and can be jointly trained to learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations. Our results show that such models have distinct advantages over state-of-the-art models for recognition or generation which are separately defined or optimized."
Lu, J  (2015)	Lu, J	Transfer learning using computational intelligence: A survey	2015	4	"Transfer learning; Computational intelligence; Neural network; Bayes; Fuzzy sets and systems; Genetic algorithm"	"Transfer learning aims to provide a framework to utilize previously-acquired knowledge to solve new but similar problems much more quickly and effectively. In contrast to classical machine learning methods, transfer learning methods exploit the knowledge accumulated from data in auxiliary domains to facilitate predictive modeling consisting of different data patterns in the current domain. To improve the performance of existing transfer learning methods and handle the knowledge transfer process in real-world systems, computational intelligence has recently been applied in transfer learning. This paper systematically examines computational intelligence-based transfer learning techniques and clusters related technique developments into four main categories: (a) neural network-based transfer learning; (b) Bayes-based transfer learning; (c) fuzzy transfer learning, and (d) applications of computational intelligence-based transfer learning. By providing state-of-the-art knowledge, this survey will directly support researchers and practice-based professionals to understand the developments in computational intelligence-based transfer learning research and applications.

Taylor, ME  (2009)	Taylor, ME	Transfer Learning for Reinforcement Learning Domains: A Survey	2009	4	"transfer learning; reinforcement learning; multi-task learning"	The reinforcement learning paradigm is a popular way to address problems that have only limited environmental feedback, rather than correctly labeled examples, as is common in other machine learning contexts. While significant progress has been made to improve learning in a single task, the idea of transfer learning has only recently been applied to reinforcement learning tasks. The core idea of transfer is that experience gained in learning to perform one task can help improve learning performance in a related, but different, task. In this article we present a framework that classifies transfer learning methods in terms of their capabilities and goals, and then use it to survey the existing literature, as well as to suggest future directions for transfer learning work.
Bruzzone, L  (2010)	Bruzzone, L	Domain Adaptation Problems: A DASVM Classification Technique and a Circular Validation Strategy	2010	2	"Domain adaptation; transfer learning; semi-supervised learning; support vector machines; accuracy assessment; validation strategy"	This paper addresses pattern classification in the framework of domain adaptation by considering methods that solve problems in which training data are assumed to be available only for a source domain different (even if related) from the target domain of (unlabeled) test data. Two main novel contributions are proposed: 1) a domain adaptation support vector machine (DASVM) technique which extends the formulation of support vector machines (SVMs) to the domain adaptation framework and 2) a circular indirect accuracy assessment strategy for validating the learning of domain adaptation classifiers when no true labels for the target-domain instances are available. Experimental results, obtained on a series of two-dimensional toy problems and on two real data sets related to brain computer interface and remote sensing applications, confirmed the effectiveness and the reliability of both the DASVM technique and the proposed circular validation strategy.
Zhu, F  (2014)	Zhu, F	Weakly-Supervised Cross-Domain Dictionary Learning for Visual Recognition	2014	1	"Visual categorization; Image classification; Human action recognition; Event recognition; Transfer learning; Weakly-supervised dictionary learning"	We address the visual categorization problem and present a method that utilizes weakly labeled data from other visual domains as the auxiliary source data for enhancing the original learning system. The proposed method aims to expand the intra-class diversity of original training data through the collaboration with the source data. In order to bring the original target domain data and the auxiliary source domain data into the same feature space, we introduce a weakly-supervised cross-domain dictionary learning method, which learns a reconstructive, discriminative and domain-adaptive dictionary pair and the corresponding classifier parameters without using any prior information. Such a method operates at a high level, and it can be applied to different cross-domain applications. To build up the auxiliary domain data, we manually collect images from Web pages, and select human actions of specific categories from a different dataset. The proposed method is evaluated for human action recognition, image classification and event recognition tasks on the UCF YouTube dataset, the Caltech101/256 datasets and the Kodak dataset, respectively, achieving outstanding results.
Li, W  (2014)	Li, W	Learning with Augmented Features for Supervised and Semi-Supervised Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation	2014	2	"Heterogeneous domain adaptation; domain adaptation; transfer learning; augmented features"	In this paper, we study the heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA) problem, in which the data from the source domain and the target domain are represented by heterogeneous features with different dimensions. By introducing two different projection matrices, we first transform the data from two domains into a common subspace such that the similarity between samples across different domains can be measured. We then propose a new feature mapping function for each domain, which augments the transformed samples with their original features and zeros. Existing supervised learning methods (e. g., SVM and SVR) can be readily employed by incorporating our newly proposed augmented feature representations for supervised HDA. As a showcase, we propose a novel method called Heterogeneous Feature Augmentation (HFA) based on SVM. We show that the proposed formulation can be equivalently derived as a standard Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) problem, which is convex and thus the global solution can be guaranteed. To additionally utilize the unlabeled data in the target domain, we further propose the semi-supervised HFA (SHFA) which can simultaneously learn the target classifier as well as infer the labels of unlabeled target samples. Comprehensive experiments on three different applications clearly demonstrate that our SHFA and HFA outperform the existing HDA methods.
Kendall, A  (2015)	Kendall, A	PoseNet: A Convolutional Network for Real-Time 6-DOF Camera Relocalization	2015	1		We present a robust and real-time monocular six degree of freedom relocalization system. Our system trains a convolutional neural network to regress the 6-DOF camera pose from a single RGB image in an end-to-end manner with no need of additional engineering or graph optimisation. The algorithm can operate indoors and outdoors in real time, taking 5ms per frame to compute. It obtains approximately 2m and 3 degrees accuracy for large scale outdoor scenes and 0.5m and 5 degrees accuracy indoors. This is achieved using an efficient 23 layer deep convnet, demonstrating that convnets can be used to solve complicated out of image plane regression problems. This was made possible by leveraging transfer learning from large scale classification data. We show that the PoseNet localizes from high level features and is robust to difficult lighting, motion blur and different camera intrinsics where point based SIFT registration fails. Furthermore we show how the pose feature that is produced generalizes to other scenes allowing us to regress pose with only a few dozen training examples.
Ben-David, S  (2010)	Ben-David, S	A theory of learning from different domains	2010	2	"Domain adaptation; Transfer learning; Learning theory; Sample-selection bias"	Discriminative learning methods for classification perform well when training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. Often, however, we have plentiful labeled training data from a source domain but wish to learn a classifier which performs well on a target domain with a different distribution and little or no labeled training data. In this work we investigate two questions. First, under what conditions can a classifier trained from source data be expected to perform well on target data? Second, given a small amount of labeled target data, how should we combine it during training with the large amount of labeled source data to achieve the lowest target error at test time? We address the first question by bounding a classifier's target error in terms of its source error and the divergence between the two domains. We give a classifier-induced divergence measure that can be estimated from finite, unlabeled samples from the domains. Under the assumption that there exists some hypothesis that performs well in both domains, we show that this quantity together with the empirical source error characterize the target error of a source-trained classifier. We answer the second question by bounding the target error of a model which minimizes a convex combination of the empirical source and target errors. Previous theoretical work has considered minimizing just the source error, just the target error, or weighting instances from the two domains equally. We show how to choose the optimal combination of source and target error as a function of the divergence, the sample sizes of both domains, and the complexity of the hypothesis class. The resulting bound generalizes the previously studied cases and is always at least as tight as a bound which considers minimizing only the target error or an equal weighting of source and target errors.
Shao, L  (2015)	Shao, L	Transfer Learning for Visual Categorization: A Survey	2015	4	"Action recognition; image classification; machine learning; object recognition; survey; transfer learning; visual categorization"	Regular machine learning and data mining techniques study the training data for future inferences under a major assumption that the future data are within the same feature space or have the same distribution as the training data. However, due to the limited availability of human labeled training data, training data that stay in the same feature space or have the same distribution as the future data cannot be guaranteed to be sufficient enough to avoid the over-fitting problem. In real-world applications, apart from data in the target domain, related data in a different domain can also be included to expand the availability of our prior knowledge about the target future data. Transfer learning addresses such cross-domain learning problems by extracting useful information from data in a related domain and transferring them for being used in target tasks. In recent years, with transfer learning being applied to visual categorization, some typical problems, e.g., view divergence in action recognition tasks and concept drifting in image classification tasks, can be efficiently solved. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms in visual categorization applications, such as object recognition, image classification, and human action recognition.
Dong, C  (2015)	Dong, C	Compression Artifacts Reduction by a Deep Convolutional Network	2015	1		"Lossy compression introduces complex compression artifacts, particularly the blocking artifacts, ringing effects and blurring. Existing algorithms either focus on removing blocking artifacts and produce blurred output, or restores sharpened images that are accompanied with ringing effects. Inspired by the deep convolutional networks (DCN) on super-resolution [5], we formulate a compact and efficient network for seamless attenuation of different compression artifacts. We also demonstrate that a deeper model can be effectively trained with the features learned in a shallow network. Following a similar ""easy to hard"" idea, we systematically investigate several practical transfer settings and show the effectiveness of transfer learning in low-level vision problems. Our method shows superior performance than the state-of-the-arts both on the benchmark datasets and the real-world use case (i.e. Twitter)."
Long, MS  (2013)	Long, MS	Transfer Feature Learning with Joint Distribution Adaptation	2013	2		Transfer learning is established as an effective technology in computer vision for leveraging rich labeled data in the source domain to build an accurate classifier for the target domain. However, most prior methods have not simultaneously reduced the difference in both the marginal distribution and conditional distribution between domains. In this paper, we put forward a novel transfer learning approach, referred to as Joint Distribution Adaptation (JDA). Specifically, JDA aims to jointly adapt both the marginal distribution and conditional distribution in a principled dimensionality reduction procedure, and construct new feature representation that is effective and robust for substantial distribution difference. Extensive experiments verify that JDA can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art methods on four types of cross-domain image classification problems.
Long, MS  (2014)	Long, MS	Adaptation Regularization: A General Framework for Transfer Learning	2014	2	"Transfer learning; adaptation regularization; distribution adaptation; manifold regularization; generalization error"	Domain transfer learning, which learns a target classifier using labeled data from a different distribution, has shown promising value in knowledge discovery yet still been a challenging problem. Most previous works designed adaptive classifiers by exploring two learning strategies independently: distribution adaptation and label propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as Adaptation Regularization based Transfer Learning (ARTL), to model them in a unified way based on the structural risk minimization principle and the regularization theory. Specifically, ARTL learns the adaptive classifier by simultaneously optimizing the structural risk functional, the joint distribution matching between domains, and the manifold consistency underlying marginal distribution. Based on the framework, we propose two novel methods using Regularized Least Squares (RLS) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), respectively, and use the Representer theorem in reproducing kernel Hilbert space to derive corresponding solutions. Comprehensive experiments verify that ARTL can significantly outperform state-of-the-art learning methods on several public text and image datasets.
Zhang, L  (2016)	Zhang, L	LSDT: Latent Sparse Domain Transfer Learning for Visual Adaptation	2016	2	"Transfer learning; domain adaptation; visualcategorization; heterogeneous data"	"We propose a novel reconstruction-based transfer learning method called latent sparse domain transfer (LSDT) for domain adaptation and visual categorization of heterogeneous data. For handling cross-domain distribution mismatch, we advocate reconstructing the target domain data with the combined source and target domain data points based on l(1)-norm sparse coding. Furthermore, we propose a joint learning model for simultaneous optimization of the sparse coding and the optimal subspace representation. In addition, we generalize the proposed LSDT model into a kernel-based linear/nonlinear basis transformation learning framework for tackling nonlinear subspace shifts in reproduced kernel Hilbert space. The proposed methods have three advantages: 1) the latent space and the reconstruction are jointly learned for pursuit of an optimal subspace transfer; 2) with the theory of sparse subspace clustering, a few valuable source and target data points are formulated to reconstruct the target data with noise (outliers) from source domain removed during domain adaptation, such that the robustness is guaranteed; and 3) a nonlinear projection of some latent space with kernel is easily generalized for dealing with highly nonlinear domain shift (e.g., face poses). Extensive experiments on several benchmark vision data sets demonstrate that the proposed approaches outperform other state-of-the-art representation-based domain adaptation methods."
Fu, YW  (2015)	Fu, YW	Transductive Multi-View Zero-Shot Learning	2015	1	"Transducitve learning; multi-view Learning; transfer Learning; zero-shot Learning; heterogeneous hypergraph"	Most existing zero-shot learning approaches exploit transfer learning via an intermediate semantic representation shared between an annotated auxiliary dataset and a target dataset with different classes and no annotation. A projection from a low-level feature space to the semantic representation space is learned from the auxiliary dataset and applied without adaptation to the target dataset. In this paper we identify two inherent limitations with these approaches. First, due to having disjoint and potentially unrelated classes, the projection functions learned from the auxiliary dataset/domain are biased when applied directly to the target dataset/domain. We call this problem the projection domain shift problem and propose a novel framework, transductive multi-view embedding, to solve it. The second limitation is the prototype sparsity problem which refers to the fact that for each target class, only a single prototype is available for zero-shot learning given a semantic representation. To overcome this problem, a novel heterogeneous multi-view hypergraph label propagation method is formulated for zero-shot learning in the transductive embedding space. It effectively exploits the complementary information offered by different semantic representations and takes advantage of the manifold structures of multiple representation spaces in a coherent manner. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that the proposed approach (1) rectifies the projection shift between the auxiliary and target domains, (2) exploits the complementarity of multiple semantic representations, (3) significantly outperforms existing methods for both zero-shot and N-shot recognition on three image and video benchmark datasets, and (4) enables novel cross-view annotation tasks.
