Automated Detection of Hummingbirds
in Images: A Deep Learning Approach

The analysis of natural images has been the topic of research
in uncountable articles in computer vision and pattern recognition (e.g.,
natural images has been used as benchmarks for object recognition and
image retrieval). However, despite the research progress in such ﬁeld,
there is a gap in the analysis of certain type of natural images, for
instance, those in the context of animal behavior. In fact, biologists perform the analysis of natural images manually without the aid of techniques that were supposedly developed for this purpose. In this context,
this paper presents a study on automated methods for the analysis of
natural images of hummingbirds with the goal to assist biologists in
the study of animal behavior. The automated analysis of hummingbird
behavior is challenging mainly because of (1) the speed at which these
birds move and interact; (2) the unpredictability of their trajectories;
and (3) its camouﬂage skills. We report a comparative study of two deep
learning approaches for the detection of hummingbirds in their nest. Two
variants of transfer learning from convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
are evaluated in real imagery for hummingbird behavior analysis. Transfer learning is adopted because not enough images are available for training a CNN from scratch, besides, transfer learning is less time consuming.
Experimental results are encouraging, as acceptable classiﬁcation performance is achieved with CNN-based features. Interestingly, a pretrained
CNN without ﬁne tunning and a standard classiﬁer performed better in
the considered data set.
