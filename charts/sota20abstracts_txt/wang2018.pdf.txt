Deep Transfer Learning for Cross-domain Activity Recognition
Human activity recognition plays an important role in peopleâ€™s
daily life. However, it is often expensive and time-consuming to
acquire sufficient labeled activity data. To solve this problem, transfer learning leverages the labeled samples from the source domain
to annotate the target domain which has few or none labels. Unfortunately, when there are several source domains available, it is
difficult to select the right source domains for transfer. The right
source domain means that it has the most similar properties with
the target domain, thus their similarity is higher, which can facilitate transfer learning. Choosing the right source domain helps the
algorithm perform well and prevents the negative transfer. In this
paper, we propose an effective Unsupervised Source Selection algorithm for Activity Recognition (USSAR). USSAR is able to select the
most similar K source domains from a list of available domains. After this, we propose an effective Transfer Neural Network to perform
knowledge transfer for Activity Recognition (TNNAR). TNNAR
could capture both the time and spatial relationship between activities while transferring knowledge. Experiments on three public
activity recognition datasets demonstrate that: 1) The USSAR algorithm is effective in selecting the best source domains. 2) The
TNNAR method can reach high accuracy when performing activity
knowledge transfer.
