Comparison between traditional texture methods
and deep learning descriptors for detection of
nitrogen deficiency in maize crops
Every year, efficient maize production is very important to the economy of many countries. Since nutritional
deficiencies in maize plants are directly reï¬‚ected in their grains
productivity, early detection is needed to maximize the chances
of proper recovery of these plants. Traditional texture methods
recently showed interesting results in the identification of nutritional deficiencies. On the other hand, deep learning techniques
are increasingly outperforming hand-crafted features on many
tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple transfer learning
approach from pre-trained cnn models and compare their results
with those from traditional texture methods in the task of
nitrogen deficiency identification. We perform experiments in
a real-world dataset that contains digitalized images of maize
leaves at different growth stages and with different levels of
nitrogen fertilization. The results show that deep learning based
descriptors achieve better success rates than traditional texture
methods.
