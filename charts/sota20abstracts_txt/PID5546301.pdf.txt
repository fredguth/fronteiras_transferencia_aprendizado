Delaunay Triangulation Data Augmentation guided
by Visual Analytics for Deep Learning


It is well known that image classification problems
can be effectively solved by Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs). However, the number of supervised training examples
from all categories must be high enough to avoid model overfitting. In this case, two key alternatives are usually presented
(a) the generation of artificial examples, known as data augmentation, and (b) reusing a CNN previously trained over a
large supervised training set from another image classification
problem — a strategy known as transfer learning. Deep learning
approaches have rarely exploited the superior ability of humans
for cognitive tasks during the machine learning loop. We advocate
that the expert intervention through visual analytics can improve
machine learning. In this work, we demonstrate this claim by
proposing a data augmentation framework based on EncoderDecoder Neural Networks (EDNNs) and visual analytics for the
design of more effective CNN-based image classifiers. An EDNN
is initially trained such that its encoder extracts a feature vector
from each training image. These samples are projected from
the encoder feature space on to a 2D coordinate space. The
expert includes points to the projection space and the feature
vectors of the new samples are obtained on the original feature
space by interpolation. The decoder generates artificial images
from the feature vectors of the new samples and the augmented
training set is used to improve the CNN-based classifier. We
evaluate methods for the proposed framework and demonstrate
its advantages using data from a real problem as case study — the
diagnosis of helminth eggs in humans. We also show that transfer
learning and data augmentation by affine transformations can
further improve the results.
