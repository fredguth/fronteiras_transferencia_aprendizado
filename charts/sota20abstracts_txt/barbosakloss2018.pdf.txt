Face Veriﬁcation: Strategies for Employing Deep Models


Features extracted with deep learning have now
achieved state-of-the-art results in many tasks. However, to
reuse a learned deep model, transfer learning with ﬁne-tuning
needs to be employed, which requires to re-train the whole
model or part of it to extract useful features in the new
domain. This step is burdensome and requires heavy computing
power. Therefore, this work investigates alternatives in transfer learning that do not involve performing ﬁne-tuning for a model
with the new domain. Namely, we explore the correlation of
depth and scale in deep models, and look for the layer/scale
that yields the best results for the new domain, we also
explore metrics for the verification task, using locally connected
convolutions to learn distance metrics. Our experiments use a
model pre-trained in face identification and adapt it to the
face verification task with different data, but still on the face
domain. We achieve 96.65% mean accuracy on the Labeled
Faces in the Wild dataset and 93.12% mean accuracy on the
Youtube Faces dataset comparable to the state-of-the-art.
