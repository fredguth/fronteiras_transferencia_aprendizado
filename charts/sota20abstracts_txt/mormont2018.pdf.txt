Comparison of deep transfer learning strategies for digital pathology

In this paper, we study deep transfer learning as a way
of overcoming object recognition challenges encountered
in the field of digital pathology. Through several experiments, we investigate various uses of pre-trained neural network architectures and different combination schemes with
random forests for feature selection. Our experiments on
eight classification datasets show that densely connected
and residual networks consistently yield best performances
across strategies. It also appears that network fine-tuning
and using inner layers features are the best performing
strategies, with the former yielding slightly superior results.
