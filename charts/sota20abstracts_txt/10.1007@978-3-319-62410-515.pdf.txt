Deep neural networks and transfer learning applied to
multimedia web mining

 The growth in the amount of multimedia content available online
supposes a challenge for search and recommender systems. This information in
the form of visual elements is of great value to a variety of web mining tasks;
however, the mining of these resources is a difficult task due to the complexity
and variability of the images. In this paper, we propose applying a deep learning
model to the problem of web categorization. In addition, we make use of a technique known as transfer or inductive learning to drastically reduce the computational cost of the training phase. Finally, we report experimental results on the
effectiveness of the proposed method using different classification methods and
features from various depths of the deep model.
