Detecting Computer Generated Images with
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

Computer graphics techniques for image generation are
living an era where, day after day, the quality of produced content is
impressing even the more skeptical viewer. Although it is a great advance
for industries like games and movies, it can become a real problem when
the application of such techniques is applied for the production of fake
images. In this paper we propose a new approach for computer generated
images detection using a deep convolutional neural network model based
on ResNet-50 and transfer learning concepts. Unlike the state-of-theart approaches, the proposed method is able to classify images between
computer generated or photo generated directly from the raw image data
with no need for any pre-processing or hand-crafted feature extraction
whatsoever. Experiments on a public dataset comprising 9700 images
show an accuracy higher than 94%, which is comparable to the literature
reported results, without the drawback of laborious and manual step of
specialized features extraction and selection.
