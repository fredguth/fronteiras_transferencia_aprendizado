Fault Diagnosis Based on improved Deep Belief Network

A fault diagnosis method based on improved Deep
Belief Network is proposed. This paper proposed an network
named Semi-DBN, which adapts an adaptive semi supervised
method to train the RBM structure to improve the
performance of DBN, replaces the Sigmoid activation function
with Rectified Linear Units to improve the performance of the
network, and combines the model with Transfer Learning to
solve the problem of lack of data. It can get rid of the
dependence of the traditional machine learning methods on the
extraction of the sample characteristics, and effectively
overcome the problem of gradient vanishing, local extremum
and so on. The identification and generalization ability of the
method is verified when we used it in the experiment of rolling
bearing data.
