Transfer Learning for Reinforcement Learning Domains: A Survey

The reinforcement learning paradigm is a popular way to address problems that have only limited
environmental feedback, rather than correctly labeled examples, as is common in other machine
learning contexts. While significant progress has been made to improve learning in a single task,
the idea of transfer learning has only recently been applied to reinforcement learning tasks. The
core idea of transfer is that experience gained in learning to perform one task can help improve
learning performance in a related, but different, task. In this article we present a framework that
classifies transfer learning methods in terms of their capabilities and goals, and then use it to survey
the existing literature, as well as to suggest future directions for transfer learning work.
