ong-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks for
Visual Recognition and Description
Models based on deep convolutional networks have dominated recent image interpretation tasks; we investigate whether models which
are also recurrent are effective for tasks involving sequences, visual and otherwise. We describe a class of recurrent convolutional
architectures which is end-to-end trainable and suitable for large-scale visual understanding tasks, and demonstrate the value of these
models for activity recognition, image captioning, and video description. In contrast to previous models which assume a fixed visual
representation or perform simple temporal averaging for sequential processing, recurrent convolutional models are “doubly deep” in
that they learn compositional representations in space and time. Learning long-term dependencies is possible when nonlinearities are
incorporated into the network state updates. Differentiable recurrent models are appealing in that they can directly map variable-length
inputs (e.g., videos) to variable-length outputs (e.g., natural language text) and can model complex temporal dynamics; yet they can be
optimized with backpropagation. Our recurrent sequence models are directly connected to modern visual convolutional network
models and can be jointly trained to learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations. Our results show that such
models have distinct advantages over state-of-the-art models for recognition or generation which are separately defined or optimized.
