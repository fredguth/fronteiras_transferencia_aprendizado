Transfer Learning for Visual
Categorization: A Survey

Regular machine learning and data mining techniques study the training data for future inferences under a
major assumption that the future data are within the same
feature space or have the same distribution as the training
data. However, due to the limited availability of human labeled
training data, training data that stay in the same feature space
or have the same distribution as the future data cannot be
guaranteed to be sufficient enough to avoid the over-fitting
problem. In real-world applications, apart from data in the
target domain, related data in a different domain can also be
included to expand the availability of our prior knowledge about
the target future data. Transfer learning addresses such crossdomain learning problems by extracting useful information from
data in a related domain and transferring them for being used
in target tasks. In recent years, with transfer learning being
applied to visual categorization, some typical problems, e.g., view
divergence in action recognition tasks and concept drifting in
image classification tasks, can be efficiently solved. In this paper,
we survey state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms in visual
categorization applications, such as object recognition, image
classification, and human action recognition.
