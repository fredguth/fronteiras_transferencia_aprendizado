Domain Transfer Multiple Kernel Learning
Cross-domain learning methods have shown promising results by leveraging labeled patterns from the auxiliary domain to
learn a robust classifier for the target domain which has only a limited number of labeled samples. To cope with the considerable
change between feature distributions of different domains, we propose a new cross-domain kernel learning framework into which many
existing kernel methods can be readily incorporated. Our framework, referred to as Domain Transfer Multiple Kernel Learning
(DTMKL), simultaneously learns a kernel function and a robust classifier by minimizing both the structural risk functional and the
distribution mismatch between the labeled and unlabeled samples from the auxiliary and target domains. Under the DTMKL
framework, we also propose two novel methods by using SVM and prelearned classifiers, respectively. Comprehensive experiments
on three domain adaptation data sets (i.e., TRECVID, 20 Newsgroups, and email spam data sets) demonstrate that DTMKL-based
methods outperform existing cross-domain learning and multiple kernel learning methods.
