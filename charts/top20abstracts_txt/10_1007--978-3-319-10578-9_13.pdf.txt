Transfer Learning Based Visual Tracking
with Gaussian Processes Regression

Modeling the target appearance is critical in many modern visual tracking algorithms. Many tracking-by-detection algorithms formulate the probability
of target appearance as exponentially related to the confidence of a classifier output. By contrast, in this paper we directly analyze this probability using Gaussian
Processes Regression (GPR), and introduce a latent variable to assist the tracking decision. Our observation model for regression is learnt in a semi-supervised
fashion by using both labeled samples from previous frames and the unlabeled
samples that are tracking candidates extracted from the current frame. We further
divide the labeled samples into two categories: auxiliary samples collected from
the very early frames and target samples from most recent frames. The auxiliary
samples are dynamically re-weighted by the regression, and the final tracking result is determined by fusing decisions from two individual trackers, one derived
from the auxiliary samples and the other from the target samples. All these ingredients together enable our tracker, denoted as TGPR, to alleviate the drifting issue
from various aspects. The effectiveness of TGPR is clearly demonstrated by its
excellent performances on three recently proposed public benchmarks, involving
161 sequences in total, in comparison with state-of-the-arts.
