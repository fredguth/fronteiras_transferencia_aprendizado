Transfer learning using computational intelligence: A survey
Transfer learning aims to provide a framework to utilize previously-acquired knowledge to solve new but
similar problems much more quickly and effectively. In contrast to classical machine learning methods,
transfer learning methods exploit the knowledge accumulated from data in auxiliary domains to facilitate
predictive modeling consisting of different data patterns in the current domain. To improve the performance of existing transfer learning methods and handle the knowledge transfer process in real-world
systems, computational intelligence has recently been applied in transfer learning. This paper systematically examines computational intelligence-based transfer learning techniques and clusters related
technique developments into four main categories: (a) neural network-based transfer learning; (b)
Bayes-based transfer learning; (c) fuzzy transfer learning, and (d) applications of computational
intelligence-based transfer learning. By providing state-of-the-art knowledge, this survey will directly
support researchers and practice-based professionals to understand the developments in computational
intelligence-based transfer learning research and applications.
