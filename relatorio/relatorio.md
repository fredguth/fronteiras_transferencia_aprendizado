co-citation analysis is advantageous for mapping the intellectual heritage of a particular field on the basis of high-impact publications, but tends to neglect the publication dynamics at the forefront of research. Bibliographic coupling, in contrast, cap- tures more recent contributions, including the classics of tomorrow, so to speak, however, this method has a blind spot with regard to the history of an intellectual field.

A co-citation is defined as the frequency with which two docu- ments1 are cited together in the literature (Small 1973). Documents are thus co-cited if they are included in the same reference list.

bibliographic coupling is said to occur when two documents have at least one reference in common (Kessler 1963). Documents are thus coupled if their bibliographies overlap.

 co-citation is a similarity relationship between two cited publications, bibliographic coupling is a measure of association between two citing publica- tions 

 co-citation analysis lends itself to tracing the intellectual roots of an academic field through the identification of its foundational works. The older a document, the longer the period in which it can have accumulated citations. Compared with the ‘classics’ of an aca- demic field, more recent publications have had less time to leave their marks, regardless of their potential to become classic works in the future. In view of that, most researchers who employ co-citation analysis acknowledge that the method is biased towards ‘the past’ .
  
  In con- trast, bibliographic coupling is suitable for detecting current trends and future priorities as they are reflected at the forefront of research.
